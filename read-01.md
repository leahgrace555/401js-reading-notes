## How to Solve Programming Prblems

### Common mistakes:
- Improper time allocation
- Rushing to the code too soon in an interview
- Rememeber to take time understanding the problem before attempting to solve it

### A simple set of steps:
- Read the problem completely twice.
- Solve the problem manually with 3 sets of sample data.
- Optimize the manual steps.
- Write the manual steps as comments or pseudo-code.
- Replace the comments or pseudo-code with real code.
- Optimize the real code.

Plan to use up to 7-% of your time on these steps beofre writing actual code. Doing this part properly is more important than working code

### Read the problem completely, twice:

### Solve the problem manuall first (confirmation):
- Put simple: programming is automation. There is nothing that be done in programming that cannot be done manually
- Solve with different inputs to make sure you really understand the solution and that it will work with more than one case
- Don't forget to check for edge cases

### Write comments or pseudo-code
- The purpose of this step is to capture the steps created in the previous step and put them into an editor as comments, or detailed enough descriptions that can be directly translated to syntactically correct code, without actually writing the code

### replace the comments/pseudo-code with real code
- This part should be easy, is should be mostly a 1-1 translation from the previous step
- If you struggle with this part, you may not have written detailed enough steps or broken down the problem enough in the previous steps
- Things you should always brush up on in the chosen language before an interview: sort list or array, creat map or dictionary, loop through a list, parse strings, convert from strings to int etc

## Act Like You Make $1000/hr

- People value their time far less than it is actually worth

### What would happen if you started acting like your time is worth 1000/hr?
- What would you still put up with?
- What would you stop wasting your time on?
- Productivity and focus both have the potential to increase exponentially

### Being busy is a sign of weakness, not a badge of honor
- It take discipline to not become “busy”
- The people around you will take all your time if you let them
- Work on cultivating extreme focus. Work with all you have while you are working, and when you’re done, enjoy the time you aren’t working.
> “The most successful people I know and not busy. They’re focused” - Jeff Goins

### As you think, so you are:
- If you allow people to think your time is free and low valued, people will treat it as such
- If you teach people that your tme is expensive and important and valuable, then people will treat it with respect.

### you can do amazing things, but only if you have time to do them:
- You probably need to say no more
- For everything you say yes to, you should have no to a dozen others
- The most successful people say no to most things because most things won’t get them to where they truly want to be

## How to Think Like a Programmer

1. Have a Framework

One of the biggest mistakes new programmers make is focussing on learning new syntax instead of learning how to solves problems

2. Understand
- The best way to solve a problem is to make sure you truly understand what is being asked
- A good indication of whether you understand the problem or not is if you can explain it yourself in plain english
- Practice writing down your problem or telling someone else about it. This can help you work through it on your own

3. Divide

- Do not try to solve one big problem. You will cry.
- Make sure to break it up into sub-problems that can be easily converted to one-by-one steps
- Once you have solved the sub problems, connect the dots

4. Stuck

- What should you do if you can't solve a sub-problem?
- Debug: step through your solution trying to find where you went wrong

5. Practice
- If you want to be a good problem solver, solve lots of problems
- Don't expect to become an expert in one week

## The 5 Whys
The 5 whys technique is a powerful tool for cutting quickly to the root of a problem, finding underlying causes rather than symptoms

### When to use the 5 whys:
- Whenever a system or process isn't working properly, give it a try
- There are cases when you should avoid using it, such as tackling a complex or critical problem. Using it in these cases can cause you to become single tracked when there may be multiple causes

### How to use the 5 whys:
- Assemble a team of people who are familiar with the specifics of the problem
- Define the problem. Discuss it with the team and write a brief, clear statement 
- Ask the first why. Record the team's answers
- Ask why four more times and respond to/record answers in succession

### Know when to stop
- When asking why no longer produces more useful responses, don't attempt to go any further
- If you not sure this method uncovered the true root of the issue, try a more in-depth problem solving method like cause and effect analysis or root-cause analysis
